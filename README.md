An expense tracker written in angular. This just me learning angular, what better way than to learn by doing and this is A good project to get started with as I managed to make it work better than the other one I worked on in the passed.


### Running

In order to run the application, make sure you got all the deps installed by doing the following:

```
npm install
```

Then do:

```
npm start

```


### How does it work?


When you launch the application, you might see A parragraph explaining what the app is in short, but then there is A checkbox. You can use it to filter by category of your expenses.

If checked, you see the category you are filtering by. Changing the category, allows for filtering by that category. The total spent by that category updates dynamicly as you change the category. Un-checking the box, will hide it and keep displaying the total spent over all. 

To add an expense, you just enter the price, then you choose the category it belongs to, then enter the expense and submit.  If successfull, you will see it being updated in the list. If the list is empty, you will be notified.

In the list, you will see the delete button for each expense. Clicking on it will delete the expense from the list and no longer ve visible.

I purposfully did not add the functionality to edit an expense as you will be able to delete and add another one again. This application does not hold your hand if you delete the expense. You need to be sure you no longer need it anymore. Besides, adding another one is not that hard at all, and it is not as if you are writing an essay to add one also.


### To do:


* I probably have to work on the styling. Since I am blind, this is not where I shine at all. Though I will probs try to do so with AI in the near future.


## Contributing

Any contributions are more than welcome. Just be sure to make A PR and I will take A look at the code and happily merge the changes if it is worth it.
